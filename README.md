# UltraPress

A theme boilerplate that utilizes the MVC pattern to bring structure and sanity to Wordpress development.

**Early in development. All ideas, features, and documentation subject to change.**

## Why?

Wordpress sucks, but a lot of developers have to work with it for various reasons outside of their control, so I decided to try and make it suck a little less.

## Setting up

1. Download a zip of the [latest stable release](https://github.com/jakecleary/ultrapress/releases/latest) and drop it into your themes folder.
2. `$ cd theme-folder-name`
3. `$ composer install`
4. `$ sudo npm i`
5. Check of the documentation (**coming soon**) to learn how to write more efficient Wordpress themes.
